// Day 2: Red-nosed Reports
//
// Important facts:
//
// - Each report is a list of numbers called **levels** that are separated by spaces.
// - The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe.
// - The safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or decreasing.
// - A report only counts as SAFE if both of the folloing are true - a) levels are either all increasing or all decreasing b) Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
